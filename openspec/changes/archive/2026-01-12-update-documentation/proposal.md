# Proposal: Update Documentation

## Goal

Create a comprehensive, Traditional Chinese README to help developers understand, install, and contribute to the project.

## Motivation

The current README is basic. A detailed documentation enhances the onboarding experience and clearly communicates the project's purpose, tech stack, and features, especially for a portfolio project.

## Scope

- Rewrite `README.md` in Traditional Chinese.
- Include sections: Project Intro, Tech Stack, Features, Installation, Scripts, Folder Structure, Contribution.
