# Proposal: Implement React Quiz Engine

## Goal

Implement a fully functional, interactive quiz application tailored for React senior developer interviews. The application will feature a "Neo-Brutalist" design aesthetic, immediate feedback mechanisms, detailed explanations, and a scoring system.

## Motivation

To provide a dedicated platform for developers to practice advanced React concepts (Virtual DOM, Hooks, Performance, etc.) in an engaging, gamified environment. The distinctive visual style aims to make the learning process less monotonous.

## Scope

- **Quiz Logic:** State management for questions, scoring, and progression.
- **UI/UX:** Implementation of the provided "Neo-Brutalism" design system (Bento grids, heavy borders, vibrant colors).
- **Content:** Integration of the provided 5-question mock dataset.
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile and desktop friendly layout.

## Out of Scope

- Backend integration (user accounts, persistent progress).
- Custom question editor (hardcoded data for MVP).
